        <h3>Solid State Drive</h3>
        <p>When considering purely optimal performance SSD is definitely in the top spot. There are no moving parts so not only does it read and write faster but it also lasts longer. On the con side however, it is also definitely on top when it comes to being very price per GB of data. Long story short SSD is high performing which makes it better if you have the money to splurge. If not then it's better to buy a small one just to increase your OS's performance or if you are running programs that are causing your disk management utilization to consistently spike.</p>

        <h3>Hard Disk Drive</h3>
        <p>HDDs while may not be as high performing are often times all you need and make it a lot more affordable to have large amounts of space on your computer. There are different variation because of different RPM speeds. The higher the speeed the better although usually 7200 or 10&#44;000 RPM give you the best bang for your buck. Lower speeds are often frustrating to deal with and higher speeds are not worth the cost as it can be comparable to buying an SSD. HDD are great for storing many games or tons of photos and videos as the performance boost of SSDs would have no affect on how fast or efficient these file would load.</p>
