        <h1>AMD vs Intel</h1>
        <p>While many people know Intel as a reputable brand since it's very commmon to own a computer that comes with an Intel processor, it is less known to the average person that AMD is an equally reputable brand. If you have ever or have looked into building your own PC you've heard of both and may wonder the difference if any.</p>
        <h3>What's the difference?</h3>
        <p>Comparing AMD and Intel is similiar to the ongoing debate of Apple and Android. Which is better is largely preference based but the biggest factors to consider in difference is performance, cost, and upgradability.</p>
        <h3> Pros and Cons</h3>
        <p> AMD cost per core is more cost efficient than it's Intel counterpart. Intel's performance is better but it's a marginal performance boost over an AMD counterpart and not worth if you're trying to be a smart spender. If you have a limitless budget then you may enjoy the performance boost of Intel. The last point to consider is upgradability. AMD gives you more room to change your CPU as it becomes convenient for you. This is ideal for users who want a decent start but to eventually give your PC a good boost. Intel lacks in this wiggle room but if you're going for your idea build right from the beginning then this wouldn't be as big of a deal to you.</p>
